Fast and simple system info (for UNIX based operating systems) written in POSIX compliant C99, that can be configured at compile time by editing the <a href="src/config.h">config.h</a> file. It uses the C Preprocessor to implement config options at compile time. <br> <br>

<h3> Why use afetch? </h3>
afetch is written in C99, meaning that it should be able to be compiled with almost all C compilers. As well as being written in a very fast language. The only bottleneck it has is the speed of your distros package manager! </p>


**Requirements**
*  `/etc/os-release` file for package count on Linux
*  A C compiler
*  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library">compatible C standard library</a> implementation

**Package count supported**

*  Alpine
*  Arch
*  Arch7
*  ArchBang
*  Arco
*  Artix
*  CelOS
*  Debian
*  Deepin
*  Elementary OS
*  EndeavourOS
*  Fedora (slow due to package manager)
*  FreeBSD
*  Gentoo
*  MacOS (homebrew)
*  Manjaro
*  Mint
*  NetBSD
*  NixOS
*  OpenBSD
*  OpenSUSE Leap (slow due to package manager)
*  OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (slow due to package manager)
*  Parabola
*  Pop!\_OS
*  postmarketOS
*  Slackware
*  Solus
*  Ubuntu
*  Void
*  Zorin

afetch is made to be run anywhere, but if your operating system isn't in the list above then open an issue! If on Linux please show the output of `cat /etc/os-release`, or if you're using something else then `uname -s`. 


**Configuration options**
*  Custom text for each seperate row of info
*  Force upper/lowercase text
*  Option to print colour blocks, and choose a character for the block
*  More to be implemented soon



**To do**
*  Make README.md more dynamic (adapt to different screen sizes)
*  Add links to information about distros in README.md
*  Find more efficient ways to do certain things, like the `/etc/os-release` part on Linux.
*  Create CONFIG.md file with in depth guide to customisation
